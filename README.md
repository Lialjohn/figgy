### aka an app to help with speed sketch practice

Online figure drawing apps are nice, but don't meet my exact needs. The goal is to have a highly customizable image randomizer, that I can use every morning when I do my sketch warm ups.

The images folder is where all image category folders go. Which is why it's empty. Maybe 1 default folder though?

todos, in no particular order:

- [] set up skip forward button functionality
- [] set up rewind button functionality
- [] have pause button visually change on click
- [] add functionality for creating directories directly in app
- [] image counter display for session
- [] fix the ugly timer rollback, happens when a slide ends
- [] hotkey functionality for control bar buttons
- [] have the app detect what folders are available and visually display them on the main options screen under 'include:'. Currently they're hard coded.
