### aka an app to help with speed sketch practice

Online figure drawing apps are nice, but don't meet my exact needs. The goal is to have a highly customizable image randomizer that I can use every morning when I do my sketch warm ups. Using electronjs because I need it to work on mac and windows both and don't want to write it twice.

The images folder is where all image category folders go. Which is why it's empty. Maybe 1 default folder though?

todos, in no particular order:

- [x] set up skip forward button functionality
- [ ] set up rewind button functionality
- [ ] have pause button visually change on click
- [ ] add functionality for creating directories directly in app
- [ ] image counter display for session
- [ ] fix the ugly timer rollback, happens when a slide ends
- [ ] hotkey functionality for control bar buttons
- [ ] have the app detect what folders are available and visually display them on the main options screen under 'include:'. Currently they're hard coded.
- [ ] display a warning when no 'include: ' category is selected
- [ ] add functionality for saving images directly through app
- [ ] look into changing image path retrieval. Maybe collect via file name rather than folder name.
