### aka an app to help with speed sketch practice

Online figure drawing apps are nice, but don't meet my exact needs. The goal is to have a highly customizable image randomizer that I can use every morning when I do my sketch warm ups. Using electronjs because I need it to work on mac and windows both and don't want to write it twice.

The images folder is where all image category folders go. Which is why it's empty. Maybe 1 default folder though?

todos, in no particular order or priority:

- [x] set up skip forward button functionality
- [ ] make executable for (my) windows OS
- [ ] set up rewind button functionality
- [x] have pause button visually change to play button on click
- [ ] add functionality for creating directories directly in app. Copy existing directories into project dir, give option to name new dir before saving
- [x] image counter display for session
- [x] fix the ugly timer rollback, happens when a slide ends
- [x] hotkey functionality for control bar buttons
- [x] have the app detect what folders are available and visually display them on the main options screen under 'include:'. Currently they're hard coded.
- [x] display a warning and cancel session when no entries given when trying to begin a session
- [ ] add functionality for saving images directly through app
- [ ] drag and drop categories to reorganize them
    - [x] add same feature to playlists
- [ ] ability to save settings, like how categories are organized, theme changes, etc.
- [ ] make an app icon!
- [x] add playlists
- [ ] add ability to change themes
- [ ] add playlist manager to remove and edit saved playlists
